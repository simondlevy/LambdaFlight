# Miniflie
Miniflie is an experimental minimalist version of the 
[Crazyflie firmware](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware),
with support for SITL simulation.  This minimalist version doesn't 
support Loco positioning or swarms, so for running your Crazyflie
you'll want to use the official Crazyflie firmware.
