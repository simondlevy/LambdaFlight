        The Flow deck gives the Crazyflie 2.X the ability to understand
        when itâ€™s moving in any direction. The VL53L1x ToF sensor measures
        the distance to the ground with high precision and the PMW3901
        optical flow sensor measures movements in relation to the ground.
        This creates a flying 3D robot that can be pre-programmed to fly
        distances in any direction or act as an aid for beginners where
        it creates a very stable flying platform.

config DECK_ZRANGER2
    bool "Support the Z-ranger deck V2"
    default y
    help
        The Z-ranger deck V2 uses a laser sensor to measure the distance to
        the ground. The deck enables the Crazyflie to automatically maintain
        a constant distance to the objects under it when flying in automatic
        mode. Over a floor it will stay on the same height, but will follow
        the flow of a stair case up or down when going on adventures.
