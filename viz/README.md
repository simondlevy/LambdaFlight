## Hackflight Visualizer app

<p align="center"> <img src="media/hfviz.png" width=500> </p>

HFViz is a simple visualization app that lets you see the
orientation of your vehicle and your RC channels and individually test the
motors (after removing propellers!). Unlike the more sophisticated 
Betaflight Configurator and Ardupilot Ground Control Station, HFViz
is not meant to help you configure your flight-control firmware, since
that is supposed to be done using C++ coding.

To build HFViz Windows, double-click on the <b>buildviz.bat</b>
file.  This will create a new folder <b>HackflightViz</b> folder containing
an executable and support files.  You can drag this new folder
into your <b>Program Files</b> folder or other convenient location.

To create a Favorites icon for HFViz on Linux, run the <b>buildviz.sh</b> script. 
Log out and log back in, and you should be able to see the icon by typing
<b>Hackflight</b> into the Activities bar.
